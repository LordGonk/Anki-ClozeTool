Short project description

# Dependencies
##Pydub
[GitHub project page](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)

Install through terminal

```
pip install pydub
```
If you have any troubles, my recomendation is to make sure you have python installed to the default
(top) directory, and that you select python to be in your system's PATH variable. Pip is included
with python.

##FFmpeg or Libav
Pydub requires FFmpeg or Libav to work. Install/unzip one anywhere and you set the location
in settings, or just follow the simple instructions below.
###Windows
My recomendation is to just [download the latest 32-bit static build of ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/static/ffmpeg-latest-win32-static.7z). Unzip it to your top directory in a folder named ffmpeg. ClozeTool assumes this as a default.
